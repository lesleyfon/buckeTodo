Because this was a full stack app, we had to create our own routes for our client to interact with the server. We had to definte everything from the `get` methods that serve up html to the `post` and `put` methods to interact with our database. So many interconnected parts meant that the Front-end and the Back-end developers had to maintain good communication to produce a coherent product.


## Models.

We chose to keep the models for the app simple for now: each `user` has many `Buckets` and can save multiple links in each bucket. In addition, a user can create new bucket.
