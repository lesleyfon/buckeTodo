Because this was a full stack app, we had to create our own routes for our client to interact with the server. We had to definte everything from the `get` methods that serve up html to the `post` and `put` methods to interact with our database. So many interconnected parts meant that the Front-end and the Back-end developers had to maintain good communication to produce a coherent product.
